#Apptodo

Apptodo is a simple single-page application (SPA) built with React. It allows users to create, delete, and update todo items, which are stored in local storage for persistent access. This app was created as a training project to gain experience with React development before embarking on a larger-scale project.

#Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to develop this app:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React DOM: The package that provides the necessary bindings to render React components in the browser.
React Router DOM: A library that enables client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between different pages of the app without a full page reload.
Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework that provides a responsive design system for building attractive and consistent UI elements.

#Installation
To run Apptodo on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone <repo url>.
Install the required dependencies using npm install.
Run the app using npm start.

#Usage
Once the app is up and running, you can use it to manage your todo list by performing the following actions:
Add a new todo: Type a new todo item into the input field at the top of the page and press Enter to add it to the list.
Update a todo: Click on a todo item to mark it as complete or incomplete. Double-click on a todo item to edit its text.
Delete a todo: Click on the "X" button next to a todo item to remove it from the list.
